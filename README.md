# Prime-Factorization-Using-the-Sieve-of-Atkin-for-Prime-Generation
This is a a simple implementation of integer factorization that combines the Sieve of Atkin for prime generation with classical trial division. Although this is not a novel algorithm in computational number theory, it provides an educational exploration of how advanced prime sieves can be integrated into factorization routines.
